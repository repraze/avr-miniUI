avr-miniUI
==========

You can test the simple functionality of the UI system with the test program.

The library is not finished yet.

Functionalities
----------------

The UI system allows you to display menus at a coordinate simply by a call of a function.
This function will return the index of the button called.
It also allows you to change all the colour parameters.

Similar functionalities should be included to ease the creation of simplistic UIs for the board.
